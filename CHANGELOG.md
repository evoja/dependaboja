## v0.0

#### [0.0.2] - [2022-01-26][c-0.0.2]
##### Fixed
* Start supporting dependabot configs which contained several sections with the same target branch.

#### [0.0.1] - [2022-01-23][c-0.0.1]
##### Fixed
Change order of one step that was responsible for reporting of skipping behaviour.
Invalid order caused a tiny mistake that didn't affect the main feature.
Only in case of skipping the reporting step it was not invoked.

##### Added
Some inline comments which explain structure and behaviour of the action.


#### [0.0.0] - 2022-01-22
Merge dependabot PRs to aggregated branches and sync the aggregated branches with master.
